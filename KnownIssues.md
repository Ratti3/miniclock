# All of the below will be fixed...

    # FIXED - Word Mode - Some words don't fit. - FIXED
    # FIXED - Word Mode - Some words display in wrong order. - FIXED
    # Possible Issue - If barometric pressure < 1000, it may not display properly. Summer here so can't test :)
    # Crashes when swithing between word clock and other modes, crash occurs when NTP() function is called. Haven't been able to figure
      out why. One of the reasons why I had to move data back from Progmem and get rid of manual NTP update.
